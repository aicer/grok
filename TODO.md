### Outstanding Tasks ###

  //@TODO build class capable of
  // 1. Loading default dictionary using class loader from classpath (make sure built-in patterns are in the CP)
  // 2. Loading additional dictionaries (if available and specified)
  // 3. Compiling pattern
  // 4. Executing example strings against patterns for data extraction

  // For Flume, GrokInterceptor, extracted data will be injected into headers
  // One expression per header field/body compiled and stored in maps for execution later against incoming values
